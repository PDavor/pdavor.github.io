    <p>Bronn's house of Highgarden is a newly formed Great House of Westeros. It rules over the Reach, a vast, fertile, and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros, from their castle-seat of Highgarden as Lords Paramount of the Reach after taking control of the region from House Tyrell, following their extinction as a result of the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and the Sack of Highgarden.</p>

<p>The house was founded by Ser Bronn of the Blackwater and raised to power as fulfillment of a debt owed by Tyrion of House Lannister, the Hand of the King to the first elected king, Brandon I Stark. The sigil of the house is a flaming arrow, symbolizing Bronn's role during the Battle of the Blackwater. The official name and words of the house are unknown.</p>

<p>Bronn was a sellsword who first encountered Lord Tyrion Lannister when he was arrested by Catelyn Stark at the Inn at the Crossroads just prior to the War of the Five Kings.[1] Bronn was among the men who traveled with Catelyn as she brought him to her sister, Lysa Arryn, at the Eyrie in the Vale for trial,[2] and Bronn fought and won in a trial by combat for Tyrion.[3] Bronn continued to travel with and work for House Lannister, guarding Tyrion in King's Landing and fighting for him at the Battle of the Yellow Fork and the Battle of the Blackwater.[4][5] As a result for his heroism at the Battle of the Blackwater, Bronn was knighted as Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.[6]</p>

<p>Ser Bronn was wed to Lady Lollys Stokeworth by Cersei Lannister to strip Tyrion of any potential champions in his trial for the Purple Wedding,[7] but the arrangement was later broken by Jaime Lannister in order to enlist Bronn's aid. Bronn accompanied Jaime to Dorne in an attempt to rescue Myrcella Baratheon,[8] served Jaime at the Second Siege of Riverrun, and fought at the Battle of the Goldroad.[9] Bronn sought a castle and a noble lady as a wife, which Jaime promised him after stripping him of his chance of acquiring the rule of Castle Stokeworth.[10]</p>

<p>After Jaime abandoned his sister, Cersei tasked Ser Bronn with murdering her two brothers for committing treason,[11] promising to give Bronn Riverrun, but Bronn instead negotiated with the Lannister brothers at Winterfell after the Great War ended since he thought that Daenerys has a good chance of winning, threatening to kill them if they didn't follow up on their debts owed to him. Tyrion promised to make Bronn Lord of Highgarden and lord of the Reach if he spared them and they won the war, to which Bronn agreed.[12]</p>
